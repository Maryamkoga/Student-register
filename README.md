# Student-register
Program to register students for an exam
- This program takes in the number of students registering for the exam
- Each student confirms their attendance for the exam by entering their student ID
- This program also ensures the number of students registering does not exceed the maximum number of students to be registered for the exam
- It also ensures each student ID can only be registered once
- The student ID's are stored in a list, sorted and written to file to be used as an attendance list at the exam venue
